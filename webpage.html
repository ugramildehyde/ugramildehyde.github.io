    <h1 id = "title"> I like Art! </h1>
    <p> I grew up in a house with an English teacher and a cartoonist, so growing up, I found myself constantly writing and reading, but I did not find myself enjoying art until I saw my friends in middle school drawing. I decided that I was going to be better at art than them, and so it became my goal to be better. I stuck with it past middle school, and I now plan on going to an art university for a degree in illustration. I did not forget about writing, however, and I have written and completed a book of poetry. My favorite art types are
    <a href="http://www.contemporaryartdaily.com/"> contemporary and abstract.</a>
    <h4> I have some samples of my writing and work on my art <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/lagoonstew/?hl=en"> instagram page</a> (It hasn't been updated in a while!). Some of my inspirations are Jonas Woods, who currently has an exhibit at the DMA, and many instagram cartoonists.</h4>
